# MyFunCity
Due to the current panademic situation and the lockdown, people have to stay home and for several months to, so they miss going out and being in their city. 
For the Flutter Hackathon 2020 we thought of making a city simulation that contains the places frequently visited like: shops, restaurants, schools and people will have access to their services online.
Plus it has some cool sounds effects that makes you feel as if you are in the ciity and you get the chance to chat with others inthe same region or city.
